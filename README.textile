h1. jQuery Infinity Scroll

Yet another infinite scroll plugin... 

h3. Goals

* Deal in JSON, don't ask ajax requests to return HTML
* Be templating/rendering agnostic - plug in your own function to handle returned data
* Allow for flexible callbacks, with or without custom params
* Follow jQuery plugins as close as possible (and as best I understand them!)

h3. Caveats
* Currently the plugin assumes you are scrolling the document, it doesn't handle DOM element scrolling, though it should
be trivial to add.

h3. Usage


```javascript
  $('tbody.someTableBody').infinitescroll(
              {
                url: http://somewhere.com/list,
                triggerAt: 50, // pixels from bottom of rendered list
                resultsPerPage: 50,
                appendTo: $('tbody.someTableBody'), // could technically append to different DOM object, not sure this is
  necessary
                params: { userId: 5, otherInfo: 'test' },
                renderData: function(data, element){ /* do stuff to render JSON to your element */ },
                error: function () { /* handle ajax error */ },
                loadOnInit: false // opt out of auto-loading so we can control when it first loads, by calling $element.infinitescroll('reset')
              });

```
