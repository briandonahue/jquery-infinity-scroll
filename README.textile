h1. jQuery Infinity Scroll

Yet another infinite scroll plugin... Initially inspired by https://github.com/brianmario/jquery-infinite-scroll 

h3. Goals

* Deal in JSON, don't ask ajax requests to return HTML
* Be templating/rendering agnostic - plug in your own function to handle returned data
* Allow for flexible callbacks, with or without custom params
* Follow jQuery plugins as close as possible (and as best I understand them!)

h3. Caveats
* Currently the plugin assumes you are scrolling the document, it doesn't handle other DOM element scrolling (scrolling
* DIVs, etc), though it should be trivial to add.
* I'm sure there is more that can be done to clean up and conventionalize. It's my first plugin, pulled from my own project.

h3. Usage


bc.  $('tbody.someTableBody').infinityscroll(
    {
      url: http://somewhere.com/list,
      triggerAt: 50, // pixels from bottom of rendered list
      resultsPerPage: 50,
      appendTo: $('tbody.someTableBody'), // could technically append to different DOM object, not sure this is
necessary
      params: { userId: 5, otherInfo: 'test' },
      renderData: function(data, element){ /* do stuff to render JSON to your element */ },
      error: function () { /* handle ajax error */ },
      loadOnInit: false // opt out of auto-loading so we can control when it first loads, by calling $element.infinityscroll('reset')
    });
